Over the last 12 months we’ve seen dramatic growth in the [Digital Marketing](http://www.tomango.co.uk/creates/online-marketing/) part of our business. Recognising the need to add to our numbers, in the summer we set out to recruit the right talent to make sure we continue delivering great work for our clients.

And now, after a thorough and painstaking recruitment process, we’re delighted to welcome the newest member of the Tomango team, [Sid Hiremutt](http://www.tomango.co.uk/is/sid-hiremutt/).

Sid graduated from the University of Portsmouth in 2014 where he studied Digital Media (BSc), and since then has completed a six month digital marketing internship, gaining qualifications in Google Adwords and Google Analytics.

An extremely switched-on keen bean, he now wants to push his knowledge as far as possible to learn new marketing strategies and concepts, and help to build our clients’ [online marketing](http://www.tomango.co.uk/creates/online-marketing/).

I grabbed a few minutes with him at the end of his first week to see how he was settling in, and find out more about him.

## Welcome aboard Sid. How was your first week?

It was really enjoyable. The team helped me get settled in very quickly and I was able to meet a few online marketing clients and really get a feel for how the team works.

## What did you think about the rest of the team?

They’re great! They’ve been very welcoming from day one and really made me feel part of everything and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed getting to know everyone.

## What are you most looking forward to?

I’m looking forward to getting to know all the clients and understanding their specific needs and expectations, so I can help deliver them great results. I’m also looking forward to learning new digital marketing strategies to help further my own knowledge.

## Where did you work before?

For the last six months I’ve been doing an unpaid internship at Barkweb in Eastbourne, where I got a good grounding in several different disciplines. At the same time, I worked as a kitchen assistant at a Nursing Home; the team there were very close and I was very well looked after, as I spent a lot of my time ‘food-tasting’ the chef’s cakes.

## What would be your perfect weekend?

My perfect weekend would start with a late Saturday wakeup and a big greasy fry up, followed by playing a home rugby game (with a match win of course!). Then celebratory beers after with all my friends, probably taking me through rest of the evening. Then the Sunday would primarily consist of eating copious amounts of pizza and chocolate cake whilst watching a few of my favourite films and TV series.

## Do you have a party trick or any hidden talents?

I have a few strange party tricks. Firstly, I can move my ears up and down on their own, secondly I can do handstand push-ups and finally, I can make a napkin into a chicken shape with a few intricate folds…

## It's traditional to bake a cake for the whole team on your birthday - what cake can we expect?

Well, I love chocolate cake and my favourite chocolate bar is a Yorkie. So I’d like to have a go at combining the two and making an awesome Yorkie chocolate cake. With that in mind, the last time I baked a cake was over ten years ago, so it may take a few attempts to get it right!

## If you could invite anyone (alive or dead) to a dinner party, who would you invite?

It would have to be:

David Attenborough – I love my wildlife/nature documentaries, and Attenborough would definitely have some great stories to tell.

Jason Robinson - Growing up he was my sporting idol and someone who had me glued to the TV whenever he was playing.

Richard Pryor – One of the funniest comedians in my opinion and he would provide me with a great deal of laughs!

##  If your house was on fire and you could only save one thing, what would you grab?

I’d probably have to save something sentimental such as my family photo album, other than that nearly everything else can be replaced fairly easily.

So there you go.

Next time you’re in the area, pop in and ask Sid to make you a chicken from a napkin.
