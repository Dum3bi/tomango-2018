Last year, Tomango dealt with more clients and took on more work than ever before. As part of our expansion plans we recognised we needed to add to our team.

Therefore I'm delighted to welcome our newest team member - Junior Web Developer Kieran Karn!

Kieran's still a student at the moment and he'll be shortly taking his A-levels at Heathfield Sixth Form.

He's got a real passion for [web development](http://www.tomango.co.uk/creates/web/development/), and has some valuable experience in online marketing from using social media in his previous job at Starbucks. He's keen to learn more about developing websites, online marketing and brand design - and can't wait to get stuck in.

After Kieran's first day with us, I asked him a few quickfire questions to get to know a bit more about him;

## Welcome to the team, Kieran; how was your first day?

It was brilliant. I felt like part of the team straight away and felt ready to get stuck in. When I finished I couldn't wait to go back to work!

## What do you think about the rest of the team?

They're a tightly-knit group of people, they all get on well with each other and work well together. I think I could easily fit in to the team, they're all very welcoming and helpful if I got stuck with something.

> "I find it so rewarding to solve a tricky piece of code."


## What are you most looking forward to?

I'm looking forward to getting to know more about coding and building websites. I enjoy a challenge and I find it *so* rewarding solving a tricky piece of code. Also since this is my first office job, I'll be interested in finding out how Tomango works and what to expect in the future.

## Where did you work before?

I was a Barista at Starbucks, I spent a year and a half working there at the weekends. I've made so many friends working there and I'm going to stay in touch with them all. The store that I worked at is on my way to work now. So I'll definitely be stopping off there in the morning on my way to work to get my caffeine fix, and have a chat with my old colleagues.

## So, you must make a mean cup of coffee then?

Yes, I have become quite the coffee expert! I spend a lot of time at home making lattes and skinny mocha frappuccinos with the coffee machine. It's tea that's a bit of a grey area... I'm someone who puts the milk in first, and it's already sparked some debates in the office!

> "I'm __almost __fluent in speaking French"


## Any other hidden talents?

Well I'm in my last year at Heathfield Sixth Form, and I'm studying A-Level French there. So I'm __almost__ fluent in speaking French - Mange tout, Rodney...

## It's traditional to bake a cake for the team on your birthday - what cake can we expect?

I've always been a big fan of chocolate cake, especially the ones with Maltesers or pieces of Mars bar on top... I've always wanted to attempt the Creme Egg cake, it looks pretty yummy!

## If you could invite anyone (alive or dead) to a dinner party, who would you invite?

That's a tough one, but since I'm a *huge* fan of comedy TV shows, I'd have to invite;

- *Miranda Hart* - Tallest female comedian out there, famous for falling over all the time.

- *Amy Poehler* - Stars in my favourite TV show; Parks and Recreation.

- *Michael McIntyre* - Stand-up comedian, famous for his hair, which seems to have a mind of its own!

There'd be lots of laughter at that dinner table.

## If your house was on fire and you could save only one thing, what would you grab?

Obviously if any of my family were still in the house I'd save them, but if they were all safe then I'd probably reach for my laptop - I know it's only an object, but it contains all my photos, school work and emails. I think I'd die if I lost all of that at once.

> "At the end of October I'm in Christmas mode and want to put up the tree and decorations straight away."


## And this is very important...do you like Christmas?

Yes I *love* Christmas! I love spending time with family and friends at that time of year, and as soon as my Birthday's been and gone at the end of October I'm in Christmas mode and want to put up the tree and decorations straight away.

So there you have it.

Next time you're nearby, pop in and ask Kieran to make you a coffee...you won't be disappointed.
