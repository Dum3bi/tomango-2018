Whether you own a small flower shop in a village, or you’re a multinational fast-food franchise, Facebook can play an incredibly important and valuable part of your online marketing strategy.

As the biggest social media platform on the web, with around 1.3 billion users worldwide, it’s a good idea to have a presence on Facebook, even if you're a small business. Whilst it’s a step in the right direction to *have* a Facebook page, it’s just as important to manage it properly.

Facebook and other social networking sites change frequently, which means there's rarely enough time to design the perfect formula on how to manage a company Facebook page before everything changes. But there are a few simple things you can do to help build and engage your client base:

## Profile Picture and Cover Photo

The way you present your company on Facebook is very important in helping to build up a good reputation with your customers. A clean and presentable profile page is the first thing you should get into shape.

Putting a profile picture on your Facebook page is a must. As well as a cover photo, these images make your profile look more visually appealing to your audience. It’s important you choose the right photos; it’s a good idea to make your profile picture your company logo, as this appears on your profile, comments and status updates. You can be a bit more adventurous with your cover photo; something like an image of your office or shop front might be a good idea.

For both these images, make sure that they're high quality, and the right size. The correct dimensions for these images are as follows;

Profile Picture – At least 180x180 pixels

Cover Photo - At least 851x315 pixels

If you've got accounts on other social networking sites, it's a good idea to make sure you use the same Profile Pictures in all of them. This makes all your pages consistent and easier to recognise.

## Company Information

Make sure your company profile is filled out properly.  If you’re a shop it's a good idea to include opening times, because customers are now more likely to use Facebook than anything else to find out when you're open.

## Posting Status Updates

There are loads of different opinions as to how frequently you should post updates. Some say as much as three times a day, every day, whereas others tell you to stick to just one post each day.

I think it’s important to think about *quality* rather than *quantity.* If you don’t have enough quality things to post about three times a day, then it's not worth composing a half-hearted post just for the sake of it, as users become less engaged and it may in fact drive customers away. In my opinion though you should stick to posting at least once a day, to keep your company name on customers’ news feeds.

## Types of post

Facebook includes a powerful tool for businesses.

Using its [insights page](https://www.facebook.com/business/products/pages#insights), you can find out stacks of information about your audience demographic. You can also see how your different posts have performed.

It's been proven that statuses with images perform much better in terms of reach compared to a status with no photo. This is because people are more likely to look at posts that are visually appealing. As you can see from the example below, the difference between the reach of a post with a photo and one without is significant. Overall, it's been shown that posts with photos receive 37% more engagement than those without.

If you want to get your audiences engaged with your content, it's also been shown that composing your posts as a question stimulates audiences to reply.

## When to post

It's best to post between 6-11pm, as this is when there's the largest amount of users active on Facebook. This means your post is going to be seen by more people and get a higher reach.

## Conclusion

Like it or loathe it, Facebook is so big you can't ignore it. By following these few simple steps, you can make it a valuable advertising tool for your business.
