In my second installment of looking at the cunning and irritating emails we call spam, I'm going to be looking into why you could be receiving so much spam, and (hopefully) how to reduce it.

If you haven't already read my first article; '[how to spot spam emails'](/blog/how-to-spot-spam-emails/), you might want to go ahead and check that out, so you're clued up on spam emails.

## How do they get my email address?

I regularly get asked this question, and the answer is it's difficult to say how they've got hold of your email. There are many ways they can do so, and some of them aren't entirely legal:

- *Leaked account databases* - An easy way for spammers to gather long lists of email addresses is from leaked databases. Large companies and social media sites such as Sony, Adobe, and Tumblr have all had a security breach in the past, compromising thousands of users personal details, including email addresses.
- *Scraping the web *- The traditional way for spammers to get email addresses is by scraping the web, similar to the way Google crawls through the internet indexing pages, spammers will scan websites looking for emails.
- *Making a good guess *- It may take a while, but spammers use tools to generate and guess common usernames, and send them to email addresses, hoping they'll get through to someone. For this reason, email addresses that begin with info@ or support@ receive a little more spam, because they're very common usernames, and easy to guess.
- *Signing upÂ  *- One of the simplest ways they can get your email address is by simply handing it over to them. When you create an account on a website, most of the time they'll ask if you want to be signed up to their mailing list, which most of the time, you don't.


It's useful to know how they can get hold of your email address, as that's part of the key to reducing the amount of emails you receive. Due to some of these methods of getting your email address, it's simply not possible to prevent all spam from reaching your inbox, but it certainly pays off trying to prevent as much of it as possible.

## How to reduce the amount of spam email you receive


### Always check what you're signing up to

If you decide to sign up to a website, just double check you're not unknowingly signing up to anything you don't want to be signed up to. There's usually a check box towards the end of the sign up form that asks whether it's okay to send you newsletters and so on. Most of the time the answer is no, so you're going to want to check that box is filled out correctly.

If it's too late for you, and you've already signed up to a mailing list you didn't want to be on, companies have to give you the option to opt-out at any time, and usually supply a link to 'unsubscribe' at the bottom of their emails. Just click that link and 'hey presto', you're off their list.

### Create a separate email address for website signups

Some people have even gone as far as setting up a separate email address for signing up to websites, so all of the spam gets diverted away from your inbox. This definitely reduces the risk of your real email address being compromised, so it's worth setting up if you have the time.

There are even websites such as [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/en/), that create a temporary email address which then deletes once you're finished creating an account. This is particularly useful if you're signing up to a site which is slightly dubious, and doesn't look like it has very good credentials.

### Don't shout about your email address

Unless you really have to publicise your email address, it's worth keeping it as private as possible. Since spammers scan the web for email addresses on message boards and chat rooms, it definitely pays off to try to keep your email address as private as possible.

### Don't reply to them

If spammers have guessed you're email address, getting a reply only confirms to them that your email address is being used. So it's best if you receive a spam email to just mark it as spam, and get rid of it.

Also, if you think a message is spam, if there are any images on the email, make sure you don't download them. The simple act of downloading an image tells the spammer that your email address is active, and more spam will follow.

### Filter it out

If you're using email programs such as Outlook or Mac Mail, if you mark a message as spam, it will learn about the email and after a while become an expert at blocking out the spam.

If you're getting spam emails from one particular email address, you can simply blacklist their email address, which means any email from that sender won't get through to you.

It definitely varies how much spam email you receive in a day, if you're suddenly receiving a lot more spam emails than you're used to, then it's worth checking to see if an account you've made on a website has been hacked. There's a useful website to check this called '[Have I been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)', this is a free service setup by a regional Microsoft director, and looks up your email address to see if you have an account that may have been compromised due to a recent security breach.
