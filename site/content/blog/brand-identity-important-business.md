Many years ago, when we were "just" a website design company and didn't do brand identity, I was sceptical about the value of spending time and money developing a quality brand.  I mean, a logo's not that important, surely? (I thought).  But I was a bit naive back then, to be honest, and have since seen the error of my ways.

In this post, I'm going to try and share with you the solid, down-to-earth reasons why a quality brand identity is important to *your* business and the benefits it can bring you.

## What is brand identity

Your [*brand*](http://www.tomango.co.uk/creates/brand/) could be described as "what people say about you when you're not there".  It encapsulates your values and principles as a business and should run through everything you do - how you answer the phone, how your write your emails, everything.  According to Mr Wikipedia (and when was he ever wrong?) the outward expression of a brand – including its name, trademark, communications, and visual appearance – is *brand identity*.

The strongest brand identities are instantly recognizable - even to small children - and immediately convey a message about that business.  Large companies like Apple, Coca Cola, Adidas, Nike etc spend millions and millions of dollars, pounds and euros every year to promote and develop their brands, because they know it directly affects their sales and market share.

## Why is it important to my business?

"But I'm not Apple!" I hear you cry.  Fair enough, but there are several well-established benefits associated with a strong brand identity that *all* businesses can enjoy;

### Price premium

Brand identity commands a price-premium. Why is someone willing to pay thousands of pounds more for a Lexus than for a Toyota? They're virtually the same product with the exception of some additional options and accessories.  You could make the same argument for Apple products (whilst running the risk of being chased out of town by a group of Apple devotees with pitchforks); many of their competitors' products are technologically just as good as theirs, but their iconic brand is often enough - on its own - to attract customers for life.

__*In layman's terms:*__ Look the part and you can charge more

### Perception of quality

This follows the age-old axiom of “you get what you pay for.” If a Lexus costs more than a comparable product, it must be because the Lexus provides better quality, right? Not necessarily. There are plenty of lower-cost, high-quality vehicles available, yet people still pay more for what they perceive to be a better or higher-quality brand.

__*In layman's terms:*__ Look better than your competitors and they'll think you are better

### Recognition and loyalty

Customers are much more likely to remember your business. A strong brand name and logo/image helps to keep your company in the mind of your potential customers.

If a customer is happy with your products or services, a brand helps to build customer loyalty across your business.

__*In layman's terms:*__ A good brand sticks in customers' minds

### Experience and reliability

A strong brand creates an image of an established business that has been around for long enough to become well known. A branded business is more likely to be seen as experienced, and will generally be seen as more reliable and trustworthy than an unbranded business.

Most people will believe that a business would be hesitant to put their brand name on something that was of poor quality.

A professionally developed brand identity positions your company to work with larger organisations and increases your margins by allowing you to set premium rates for your products and/or services.

__*In layman's terms:*__ A good brand makes you look more established and can help position you to work with the big boys

### Differentiation

Perceived quality can be a point of differentiation. Companies are continually looking for ways to differentiate their brand's identity from their competitors. Perceived quality can be used to differentiate, and in doing so, enable the company to loop back to the first benefit and charge a price premium for their strong brand.

__*In layman's terms:*__ A good brand makes you stand out from the competition

## Still need convincing?

Here's the rub; get yourself a strong brand identity and
