We all had a fantastic time yesterday evening at the Tomango summer party at our offices in Ringmer.

Around 40 guests enjoyed a glass of bubbly, some delicious canapes and excellent company and, although the weather wasn't exactly balmy, it held off raining and was warm enough for us to be able to get into a summery mood.

It must be said that I doff my cap to anyone involved with planning events.  Around 20 minutes before our first guests arrived I was swearing (literally) to never do it again.  However, everything went off without a hitch and everyone appeared to be having a spendid time.  And so, the morning - or afternoon, strictly speaking - after the night before, I am left pondering on whether this should become a regular annual event...

## Thank yous

Special mentions must go to Julian's mum for our wonderful cake, our brilliant waitresses for the evening, Alice, Erin and Emily, to Mike for his hard work designing the invitations, envelopes and his marvellous parking diagram, Trys for taking photos on the evening and Nikki and Jude for their endless organising.  It was a great team effort and thank you all.
