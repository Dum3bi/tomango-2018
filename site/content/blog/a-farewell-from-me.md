Well, it's been an exciting and challenging year for me here are Tomango; and I've now decided to put the wind in my sails and head for different waters.

At the end of this week, I'll no longer be at Tomango, so this will be my last post as a Junior Web Developer. I bet I can guess your facial expression right now;

No? Oh well, it was worth a shot.

## What am I going to do?

Come September I'll be heading off to the University of Sussex, to study Media and Communication. Before then though, I've got a few holidays planned for August, and I've got quite a lot of things to do to get ready for Uni.

## What will I miss?

I'll definitely miss working with everyone; the team we've got here really work well together, and I'm sure the person who takes over my role will fit in nicely.

I'll also miss quite a few random things when I come to think of it;

- *Trys' marvellous cake baking skills - *not only can Trys build a fully responsive, easy to use website, but he can also make a fully yummy, easy to eat cake.
- *Creating the Spotify playlist for the dayÂ *- something I find rather fun, but I'm pretty sure the rest of the team will be relieved I'm handing the controls to someone else.
- *The constant supply of tea *- as I go into student life, I'm sure the cups of tea will become few and far between.



## Who's going to be replacing you?

Well the new Junior Web Developer who will be replacing me won't be starting for a couple of weeks after I leave. In between me leaving and the new developer starting, there will be someone here to keep everything afloat; and a few of you might be familiar with them already...

But anyway, I'd just like to say it's been a real pleasure to work at Tomango for the past year. I've worked with some really interesting clients, and I wish the whole team well in all of their future projects.

Au revoir!
