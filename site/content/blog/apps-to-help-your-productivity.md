I'm pretty sure we've all read at least one blog post or news article about Productivity. All claiming they're able to 'maximise' it, and get the most out of your day by changing your workflow, time management, and priorities.

Lots of people I talk to about it struggle as they become overwhelmed by the vast tools and techniques available to them.

After trying a few of the techniques myself, I've found that the best thing to do is keep it simple.

I've also found that each person has a different technique, which turns out to be the key to maximising their work day. So what's really important is to think about what works for you. If you think you've got your productivity technique nailed, why change it?

For this reason, I'm not going to explain what techniques work for me, as that's not likely to be very useful. But what I will do is recommend some really helpful apps that help with some of the more simple tasks; email, to do lists, task tracking, and messaging.

These apps all play a part in making my day as productive as possible. So perhaps you should try them, and see how they work for you.

## For emails, it's [Gmail](https://www.google.com/intl/en/mail/help/about.html)

I've jumped around quite a lot with what email program I use. I've gone from Mac Mail to Webmail, and Mozilla Thunderbird to Microsoft Outlook.

But the truth of the matter is, I've always come back to using Gmail to manage the messages that arrive in my inbox.

Whilst it's not described as a productivity app, it certainly helps me manage my time, and definitely made me more productive.

![](images/blog/Gmail-1.png "One of the features I use on Gmail is 'markers' which means I can label items in my inbox based on what needs doing and what's been done, so I can see at a glance how busy I am.")

Gmail offers a lot of useful features, which means I can keep my inbox organised and easy to manage;

- *Email threads* - Unlike a conventional inbox, Gmail organises emails into threads, making it a little bit like messaging. This means you can quickly see what's been said, and easily go back and see what was mentioned in previous emails. This makes email feel more natural, and also means you can understand the conversation much more easily.
- *Email markers* - It's a preference of mine, but a little colour can't go amiss when it comes to organisation. By using markers on the emails arriving my inbox, I can see at a glance what emails I have 'To Do'. Emails marked 'Done' are greyed out, and ready to be archived.
- *Get all your emails into one inbox* - If like me, you've got quite a few email accounts hanging around, then Gmail is the perfect way to sort this out. You can ask Gmail to check messages in other email accounts, and deliver them to your Gmail inbox. This means everything comes through into one place - nice and simple.
- *All your emails on any device* - This is probably something I take for granted now I use Gmail permanently. Due to the fact your emails are effectively stored on a webmail service, it means they're accessible anywhere. You've also got the added benefit of a dedicated app for Gmail, which is available on your smartphone or tablet.



## For to-do lists, it's [Todoist](https://todoist.com/)

This is possibly the simplest app I use on a daily basis. A to-do list that's so simple and easy to use, I don't think I could work without it.

As a list lover, I can't get enough of making lists of things that need doing - which is why I love Todoist.

It integrates with almost any operating system or program, so it can always be there - wherever you're working.

Unlike some task managers that require tons of information to add a task, Todoist isn't especially demanding in what constitutes a task. If you want to type a quick task with a just couple of words, you can. By the same token, if you want to add more details to a task - due date, priority, category, or a reminder - then go ahead.

One of my favourite things about Todoist however, is the integration with Gmail. Todoist can sit in the corner of my screen all day, without being a nuisance getting in the way. Also, it means I can add emails to my to do list at the click of a button.

There's also a pretty neat feature that I use a lot, which is something called 'Intuitive dates'; if you type in a task such as 'Call Mark at 2pm tomorrow', it recognises the time you wrote in the task, and automatically sets the due date to be 2pm tomorrow.

## For task tracking, it's [Trello](https://trello.com/)

This is the application used by all of us in the office, and it's a perfect way for us to collaborate and work on projects together.

For those that haven't heard of Trello, it's based around the idea of boards, lists, and cards. Create a board for a particular project, fill it with lists, and fill those lists with cards, like so;

For each project we do, we create a board that contains four lists; 'To be discussed', 'To Do', 'Done', and 'Useful'. You can then fill these lists with cards, which can contain all the information you need for that particular task. You can post comments, files, checklists, labels, and add due dates. You can assign a member to a particular card, so they know what they've got to get done.

## For messaging, it's [Slack](https://slack.com/)

If youâ€™re part of a team of people who constantly need to communicate with each other, then Slack is perfect for you.

Instead of writing an email to a colleague about a question you have on a project, just message them on Slack, then all they have to do is send back a quick message, and hey presto.

This is briliant because it drops the formalities of writing an email, making life much easier.

It also has a wide range of integrations with other apps, including Trello, and Todoist, meaning you can combine all your channels into one. Some of the integrations are pretty cool, my favourite of which is the one which produces a random cat fact at your command;

With a bit of technical know-how, you can also create a custom integration, to make simple jobs much easier. My colleague Trys created a custom integration for an early warning system to notify us when we have server problems. He even wrote a blog post on how he made it, which can be found [here](http://www.tomango.co.uk/thinks/early-warning-system-slack-integration/).

## If it's not working, get rid of it

It's worth keeping in mind that after a while, the way you work will change. You may slowly find yourself relying on an app less and less. The answer is drop it if you're not using it; find something else that works better for you, or change the way you use the app to fit into your working day.

If you're keen to change your ways completely, why not try some of the productivity techniques I've already tried my hand at? You can find a few here;

- [The Pomodoro technique](http://blog.trello.com/how-to-pomodoro-your-way-to-productivity/) - a good technique to try if you struggle to concentrate on big tasks.
- [The Personal Kanban technique ](http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/#sthash.8priZXo0.dpbs)- perfect for people who try and start too many tasks but rarely finish them.
- [The action method](https://blog.todoist.com/2015/11/30/ultimate-guide-personal-productivity-methods/#The-Action-Method) - useful if you like brainstorming before a task, and need to order your brainstorm into tasks.
- [Timeboxing](http://www.roadtoepic.com/timeboxing-101-what-why-and-how/) - a great visualiser to see where your work day is actually going.
