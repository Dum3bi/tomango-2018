Tomango is delighted to announce that we've been approved for membership to the [Design Business Association](https://www.dbadirectory.org.uk/dba/directory/38823) (DBA).

As the trade association for the UK design industry, the DBA exists to promote professional excellence within the design industry and champions effective design.  It helps businesses understand why they should invest in design and builds relationships which are more professional and well adapted to one another’s needs.

The DBA is a community of over 500 design agencies and design-led businesses who share a set of values and beliefs. By belonging to the association, approved members are demonstrating a commitment to:

- The belief that design should be treated as an investment
- Delivering a return on that investment
- The highest professional standards for creative businesses


*Managing Director Mark Vaesen** said*: "Members of the DBA tend to be in the top 5 per cent of design companies nationwide and we're very proud to be part of that.

"Our view at Tomango is that design isn't just about what something looks like; good design also needs to be effective, and we're pleased that the DBA have this as a key part of their core values."

*Adam Fennelow, Head of Services at the DBA*, said: "We are thrilled to welcome Tomango to the DBA. DBA members recognise the usefulness of meeting, listening, sharing and learning with their peers. A particular focus for the association is to attract those creative businesses that want to align with a set of business values that enhance and reinforce their own.

"We look forward to supporting Tomango on their journey."

Tomango's design work is all done in-house, and covers brand identity, website design, business stationery and printed marketing literature for a range of clients of different sizes and shapes.
