No matter how careful you are with handing out your email address, no one can avoid getting the odd spam email once in a while.

I'm sure you're familiar with the kinds of emails I'm talking about; the bogus emails saying you're entitled to a large sum of money, your bank account has been compromised, or even offering you things that might make you blush...

Also known as 'phishing attacks', Spam emails have been around ever since the Internet became accessible to the public in the 1990s. The complexity and volume of spam emails being sent has increased considerably over the years.

> According to the Internet security provider [Kaspersky](http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2015/Spam-and-Phishing-in-Q1-New-domains-revitalize-old-spam), spam emails account for over 50% of all email traffic per year.

Whilst spam filters have always been able to keep out most of the unwanted junk, there will always be a few complex critters that make it through to your inbox.

There are a few simple ways you can tell an email is not legitimate, and it requires you to put your detective hat on and look at the closer details of the email.

## What's the email asking for?

Firstly, it's good to remind yourself what the purpose of these spam emails are. Usually, they want you to do one, or all of the following;

- Send over some personal information
- Send over money
- Follow a link to a website
- Download a file to your computer


If an email asks you to do any one of these, just stop and think for a minute.

## Who's the email from?

Scammers often try to impersonate people and brands, as this is an easy way to make you think the email is genuine.

Even if the email is coming from an address you recognise or have emailed before, it's not a reason to trust the email. A scammer could easily be spoofing their email, or even have gained access to their mailbox, so keep this in mind.

## 'Dear valued customer'

When the salutation of the email is something along the lines of 'Dear valued customer', it's a tell-tale sign it's a scam email.

When you sign up to a mailing list with a business, 9 times out of 10 they'll ask for your name as well, so they can address their marketing emails directly to you. Scammers don't have this information, so can only make a vague, open greeting.

On a similar note, spam emails generally don't make it clear who the email has come from. Genuine business emails will always provide contact details of the person who sent the email, so you can get in touch with someone if you have any queries.

## Don't be flustered with urgent or threatening language

Spam emails often use language that makes the issue they're alerting you to sound urgent. This can sometimes trick people into quickly reacting to the email without really thinking about what they're doing.

The threats are most of the time rather unrealistic and comical. I've come across spam emails in the past that threatened the FBI will be involved if I don't respond, which in my view would be taking things a bit far...

## Hover over the links

If there are any links in the email that you're being directed to, hover over them and check where the link will take you, but don't click on them. If there are any links at the bottom of the email, such as website addresses that say they're going to the website homepage, hover over them, and see if they direct you somewhere different. This is a neat little trick to catch out some of the more complex spam emails.

It's the same for attachments, if it's not clear in the name of the attachment what it is, don't open it.

## Still not sure?

Hopefully these tips and tricks will help you tell apart the spam from your genuine emails.

However, if you're still unsure on whether the email in question is spam, then you could always ask for a second opinion, ask the person who deals with your emails,Â  and they'll be able to help out.
