In the latest of our riveting series, we asked Web Developer Alex Southan to list the essential things he needs every day to do his job, then we arranged them on his desk and took a photo of it.

Here's what he found on his desk (clockwise from top left):

	<li>Tin of biscuits
	<li>Fingerless gloves. I feel the cold
	<li>Mouse
	<li>This is just a carrier bag I found on my desk
