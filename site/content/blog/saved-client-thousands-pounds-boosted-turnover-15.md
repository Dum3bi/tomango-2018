In February 2013, [Kelsey Plant Hire](http://www.tomango.co.uk/created/kelsey-plant-hire/)'s new website was launched and we started implementing a new online marketing strategy.  By that time, we had already saved them thousands of pounds of wasted marketing budget.  In the year after the site went live, their turnover increased by 15%.  In this post we look at how we can help you stop wasting money on ineffective marketing and grow your business in the process.

## How Kelsey __saved__ money

The problem Kelsey had was that, over the previous few years, various online marketing opportunities had been taken up without much thought to the bigger picture.  They were spending thousands and thousands of pounds every year on unnecessary "marketing" websites, expensive hosting and ineffective directory listings.

In the first phase of the project we carefully went through all the costs they were paying for their [online marketing](http://www.tomango.co.uk/creates/online-marketing/) and created a joined-up strategy that;

- Eliminated any unnecessary expenditure
- Focused on the target market
- Provided the best return on investment (ROI)

The second phase involved putting together a new strategy that would generate quality traffic and convert them into solid leads.  We designed and built a new website that not only looked good, but was structured correctly to make sure they were being found in search results and getting visitors to their website as a result.

We combined this with an ongoing SEO campaign and helped them put together a policy to improve their [social media marketing](http://www.tomango.co.uk/creates/online-marketing/social-media/).  The result is a joined up approach that is producing pretty impressive results.

## The key to organising your online marketing strategy

The pickle that Kelsey had got themselves into is not uncommon.  When you're busy running your own business, it's very easy to lose track of what you've been spending your marketing budget on.  Businesses are faced with a bombardment of information about all sorts of different approaches, which can contribute towards a rather scatter-gun approach.

### 1. Understand the different channels

Make sure you understand enough about the different channels, who uses them and how.  Ask yourself "Is this a channel that my customers use? Can I use this channel to communicate with them?"  If the answer is yes, you should consider including it in your strategy.  If you need help understanding what will work for you, [ask us](mailto:hello@tomango.co.uk).

### 2. Be realistic

You're a busy person, right?  Time and time again we see well-thought out and well-intentioned strategies go bad because the necessary resources haven't been available.  The most common mistake is thinking you can take on more than your time will allow.  Use your resources and those of your supplier to your advantage.  What can you do?  What can they do?  Who will do it to the best effect?

### 3. Document your plan and stick to it

Write down your plan.  This might sound daft, but by writing it down you can refer back to it, and that will make it easier to stick to it.  Don't be tempted to stray from your chosen path without sound, logical reasoning.  Review your plan regularly - say every three months - and be prepared to alter it in line with the successes or failures you've had.
