Treeconomics works internationally with community groups, research organisations, public bodies municipalities and private business to complete projects which highlight the value of trees.

Treeconomics approached us to give their website a new feel and design, the old site was not responsive to mobile, it also failed to get the key business services across to the visitor in a clear and concise way.

The new website is now live, it highlights the key services of the business whilst showcasing a selection of projects Treeconomics has worked on all over the world.

The re-design has also seen the introducion of a news section that is fed from social media accounts, news articles and new projects.

Another new feature of the website is the addition of a more detailed about page â€“ displaying the company mission statement, capabilites, and the team members of Treeconomics.

The new website has seen an increased number of visiors with several new lines of enquiries.
