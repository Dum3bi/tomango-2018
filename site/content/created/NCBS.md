In 2014, Agon Systems’ CEO Sean Welch came to us to help him grow his business into a global player in the EAS industry. Our work in developing a brand and marketing strategy helped the company increase its turnover by almost 200% in three years.

We created a new brand identity and commissioned photography to use in the design of business stationery, printed marketing collateral and a fully responsive website, before implementing a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.
