The National Business Crime Solution (NBCS) is a not-for-profit initiative created to tackle cross-border, serious and organised crime affecting business.

Although partly government-funded, the NBCS commissioned Tomango to create a new brand identity and website to help with its long-term objective of becoming self-sufficient through increased membership.

The new brand identity was developed and applied to a suite of business stationery, a high-spec brochure and a bespoke, fully responsive website.

As part of the project, we also created a time-lapse video which is used on the home page of the site. Filming was carried out in selected locations to represent the range of membersâ€™ businesses and edited in-house for use online.
