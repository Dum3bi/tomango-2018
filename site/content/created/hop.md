HOP came to us in the autumn of 2016 having seen the work we did for ECE Architecture. Their website no longer reflected their position in the marketplace and they asked us to redesign the site to put them back on top and ahead of their competitors.

Using the exceptional photography available – particularly of their projects – we created a contemporary, highly visual site that strengthens their brand and gives them the edge over their competitors in winning more of the projects they want.
