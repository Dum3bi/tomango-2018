We’re currently looking for talented, experienced Web Developers to work with us on a number of projects coming up in the next few months.

You’ll be working alongside our creative and digital marketing teams, taking Sketch files and building high quality websites using WordPress, delivering projects on time and to a high standard.  

It’s only fair to warn you that we’re extremely particular about attention to detail, so we’re looking to work with people who share those values and take immense pride in the work they deliver. All our sites are bespoke, start from a blank theme and only use essential plugins.

We need someone with the following attributes and skills:

- Excellent Front-end development skills
- Exceptional knowledge and experience of bespoke WordPress builds 
- Good understanding of performance and accessibility
- Knowledge of Sketch
- Experience of working with agencies as a freelancer
