**Using paid digital marketing channels can be a great way to get quick results - but set it up wrong and you can waste a lot of money.**

We have experience in planning and implementing campaigns for a number of businesses in different sectors, with our main aim being to get you the best results for your budget.

## Paid Search

Did you know that over 50 per cent of Google Search users can’t differentiate between Paid and Organic search listings?

Our Google Adwords certified team will help optimise your company’s investment in PPC, making sure it’s working to its full potential.

First, we'll find out as much as possible about your business, your target audience and your strategic goals to help inform our research.

Then we'll implement the strategy – writing and optimising ad copy, adjusting bids, and using retargeting to get the best return on your allocated budget.

Of course, all this is pointless without an adequate website. We’ll also review landing pages and user journeys to ensure your sales funnel is as streamlined as possible and keeps the business leads coming in.

## Paid Social

Creating paid campaigns on social can be a fantastic way of increasing brand awareness and interacting with your customers and supercharging your existing [social media work](/creates/digital-marketing/social-media/).

Whether it's on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, Tomango can help you create engaging content that taps into the right audiences.

From improving sales or signups, extending the reach of content, or remarketing to website visitors - we'll find the right tactics to get you the best return from your investment.
