**A vital part of digital marketing strategy, having a strong social media presence gives your business the chance to build, engage, and interact with audiences on a number of different platforms.**

The clue’s in the name – social media isn’t supposed to be used for repetitive messages aimed at driving sales, but for listening to your audience and delivering content they’re interested in seeing.

## Social media auditing and setup

We’ll assess your current social media presence, look at your competitors, and advise you on what we think are the best social media networks to reach your ideal audience moving forward.

If new accounts need to be created, we will get this done in a way that’s consistent with the ethos, tone of voice, and brand guidelines of your business.

## Social media strategy and management

Once we’ve decided which platforms are best, Tomango will then create a social strategy suited to your business goals and in line with your core values.

If you don’t have the capacity to manage this in-house, our marketing team will take the reins and produce relevant, interesting content that will keep people coming back for more – as well as providing excellent customer service when needed.

## Social media advertising

If we think your company could benefit from an extra push, Tomango may also advise integrating paid social media advertising into any social campaign.

Highly targeted and cost-effective, paid social can be a valuable means of increasing brand awareness to people in your target demographics that aren’t yet familiar with your business.
