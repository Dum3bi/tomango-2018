In the past 6 months I have worked on some great projects with the team, got married and bought my first home, it's definitely been a whirlwind for me. Nonetheless I have enjoyed every second of it!

Here’s a few things I’ve learned and accomplished and what I want to do in 2019.

## My first day and first project

I remember having a meeting with Mark on my first day, he gave me a run down of Tomango’s vision and where he wanted to take the business. Immediately I was excited and was eager to get stuck into some projects.

This first of which was a print project for [Hartwell Insurance](created/hartwell-insurance/), the brief was to design a 4-fold high spec brochure for presentations to prospective clients. Print is something that has always come natural to me, I have trained and worked in print for many years. 

After a briefing from [Mike](is/mike-vine/), I set about designing the brochure and was given the copy by [Tom](is/tom-ruzyllo/). Not only is he our [Digital Marketing Manager](creates/online-marketing/), he’s also got a talent for words. His skills have helped me learn more about the importance of good copy and good design.

On my first project the key thing I learned was to take my time, something I hadn’t had the luxury off before – coming from an artworker background where pace was an essential part of the role. I got the chance to refine my ideas and present only the best work to the client.

## Off the leash!

After spending some time learning more about the Tomango ways, and working alongside Mike I was finally ready to take the challenge of my first web design project. Slightly nervous, yet very excited I tackled a redesign of 
[Treeconomics](created/treeconomics/).

Having read the project plan Mark had produced with the client it became clear I had to design a website that got the company's vision and messages across, whilst also showcasing some of the great projects Treeconomics are involved in.

The design process was tricky but rewarding, it was the first time I’ve had to think about the ‘user’ and not just my own tastes and styles. I was always thinking about what would the user need from this page and that page, and where they would the go next. Quite a challenge for me which has unearthed a strong interest in UX design.

After a some feedback from the client we made the final changes and launched the site, that feeling of making something live or receiving a printed piece of work hot off the press will never got old for me. It’s an amazing feeling for designers, weeks or months of hard work come to life and your work is out there for everyone to see and experience.

## Getting hitched

On June 9th I got married to my best friend and soulmate Danielle, she has been very supportive over the years, despite the fact I find it hard to switch off and even critique restaurant menus or apps on date nights!

## Brand rollouts

In the 6 months I have worked at Tomango we have rolled out several new websites and brands for clients, a big part of my job is to help Mike in this process. 

We create [brand guidelines](creates/brand/) for clients to implement their brand rollout to any channels that may need to use the wordmark or logotype. Setting brand guidelines is really important to us, we want to ensure our clients image is the best it can be no matter where or what it is on.

The biggest of these projects has been our recent work for [Concept Tag](https://www.concepttag.com/), producing a new website which went live this week and all the printed collateral the client required. We have produced collateral in different language versions as the company is a global business operating in Europe, America and Australia.

## Challenges

I’ve had a few in the past 6 months, firstly having to learn a new way of working and designing, learning a lot from [Trys](https://www.trysmudford.com/) who taught me the importance of designing for mobile first. I’ve had to learn new tools and software, lucky I am quick learner. 

I’ve even re-taught myself premiere-pro to produce short video clips for marketing collateral and just recently dived back into Flash now Adobe Animate to create brand animations. These are nice challenges to have, I am constantly trying to learn new techniques or programmes to further my knowledge and experience to create great work for clients.

## User first

In 2019 I will start looking to build upon my already growing knowledge of UX and UI design. I have been following [Fabricio Teixeira](https://uxdesign.cc/@fabriciot) who has written some interesting articles on UX design
this year, especially this one [The State of UX in 2019](https://trends.uxdesign.cc/).

Building on my expanding knowledge I want to put this into practice as much as possible for clients, I believe if we do the UX research and put the users first we can help with site conversions and our clients can achieve their goals.

## In summary

I have had a blast, we have produced some great work that we are really proud off. We have worked on various projects from startups to businesses in need of refreshing their existing websites. If you need a new website, brand or just fancy picking my brains about what I have done and how we can help you [get in touch](contact/).

Cheers, Liam.
